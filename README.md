This repository implements the first part of an ORB-SLAM Algorithm in Python making heavy use of the OpenCV library. 

The complete SLAM Algorithm ist still a work in progress. I am currently working on Loop-Closing using g2o and performance increases using own implementations of the algorithm in C++. I will add additional explanations concerning the mathematics at a later stage.
